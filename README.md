# Blender-Auto-Rigger-for-Non-Humanoids
Python-powered automatic rigging system for creatures, mechas, and abstract 3D models in Blender â€“ because not everything moves like a human.

## Overview
The Blender Rigging Toolkit is a Python-based toolkit designed to automate the rigging process for various types of 3D models, including creatures, mechas, and abstract shapes. This toolkit leverages Blender's powerful API to streamline the rigging workflow, making it easier for artists and developers to create complex rigs efficiently.

## Features
- **Creature Rigging**: Generate rigs specifically tailored for organic models with features like bone creation, skin weight assignment, and constraint application.
- **Mecha Rigging**: Create mechanical rigs with joint configurations, inverse kinematics (IK) constraints, and movement settings.
- **Abstract Rigging**: Design rigs for abstract models, including shape creation, movement pattern definitions, and modifier applications.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blender-rigging-toolkit.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd blender-rigging-toolkit
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To use the toolkit, run the main script:
```
python src/main.py
```
Follow the command-line prompts to generate rigs for your models.
